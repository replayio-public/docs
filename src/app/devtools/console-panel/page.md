## Basics

### Add live console logs

You can add new console logs in Replay DevTools by finding a line of code, clicking the “+” button, adding an expression, and pressing “save”. When you add a new log, the messages will appear in the Console as if they had always been there.

### Jump to console messages

### Evaluate expressions (eagerly 🙂)

### Anchor the focus window to a message

### Add a console message prefix

### View JS event handlers

### Filter console messages

### Hide messages from node modules

### View console message timestamps

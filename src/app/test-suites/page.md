Replay Test Suites bring **time-travelling DevTools to your test runs**. Youâ€™ll get a better insight into how your test script interacts with application under test. Besides zooming in on your test execution, you can zoom out to get a birds-eye view of your teste executions and **drive down test failures and flakes**.

## Overview

Once you have your test suites integrated with Replay in CI, you can add our bot to your GitHub repository. The bot will leave comments on PRs with a summary of the most recent test run.

The comment also includes links to replays of the tests and the test run in the Test Suite Dashboard. The comment will automatically update with the most recent results every time a new commit is pushed.

For this to work, simply install our [Github App](https://github.com/apps/replay-io).

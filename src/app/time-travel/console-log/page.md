title: Add console logs on the fly
description: Replay Test Suites bring time-travelling DevTools to your existing Cypress, Playwright or any other test suites

Adding console logs in Replay is like editing your code with Hot Module Reloading. You click on a line of code, type the expression, press enter, and the messages appear in the Console.

There’s never been a faster way to ask and answer questions, test your hypothesis,  reach a state of flow while debugging.

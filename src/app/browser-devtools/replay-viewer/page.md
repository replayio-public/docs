## Time Travel

### Jump to code

Typically when something goes wrong, a usser interaction like a mouse click or key press occurs right before. The challenge is knowing which React component handled the event and kicked off a sequence of events. That’s why, clicking on the event’s **Jump to Code **button is often a good place to start.

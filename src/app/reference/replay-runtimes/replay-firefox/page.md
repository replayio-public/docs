## Replay Firefox has been deprecated

Replay Firefox was our first runtime, so it’ll always have a special place in our hearts. Unfortunately, because Chrome has such a significant market share, we decided in 2023 that we had to bet on Chrome and stop maintaining Replay Firefox.

### Use Cases

Even though Replay Firefox is currently deprecated, it will continue to be available until for two use cases.

1.  Downloading a standalone browser for recording bug reports.

2.  Recording bug reports on Windows. Replay Firefox Windows has a 40% replay crash rate, so we only recommend trying it if you’re okay putting up with reliability issues.

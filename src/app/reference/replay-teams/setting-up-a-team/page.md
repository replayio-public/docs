## Managing API Keys

Teams can create API Keys for uploading [source maps](/reference/replay-cli/source-maps) during deploys or uploading replays recorded programmatically via our [Node runtime](/reference/replay-runtimes/replay-node) or [end to end test runners](/reference/test-runners/overview).

Check out the [docs on generating API keys](/reference/ci-workflows/generate-api-key) to learn more.

## SOC 2 Type 2

System and Organization Control 2 Type 2 (**[SOC 2](https://www.aicpa-cima.com/topic/audit-assurance/audit-and-assurance-greater-than-soc-2)**) is a compliance framework developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (**[AICPA](https://us.aicpa.org/forthepublic)**) that focuses on how an organization's services remain secure and protect customer data. The framework contains 5 Trust Services Categories (**[TSCs](https://www.schellman.com/blog/soc-examinations/soc-2-trust-services-criteria-with-tsc)**), which contain criteria to evaluate the controls and service commitments of an organization.

**Replay has a SOC 2 Type 2 attestation for Security, Confidentiality, and Availability**.

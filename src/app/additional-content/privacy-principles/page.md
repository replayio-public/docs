title: Privacy principles
---
We know that in order for Replay to become your daily debugging tool we need to earn your trust. Here are a couple of our commitments:

1.  **Private by default.** You can always opt-into making replays public and sharing them with teams and collaborators, but replays default to private.

2.  **No god mode.** We know it’s become common to let employees log into user accounts, so it’s important for us to state clearly that we do not have a “god” mode. The only way we can access a replay is if you share it with us.

3.  **Browser privacy model.** When you’re debugging a replay, we run the browser in a secure sandbox that only trusted users can access. For more information, see our [security practices](https://docs.replay.io/resources/security-practices).

4.  **You own your data.** Recordings are encrypted at rest and only available to trusted users. You can delete your own data at any point.

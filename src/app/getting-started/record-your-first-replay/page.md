title: Record Your First Replay
description: Our goal is for recording a replay to be as easy recording a video. Today, you launch the Replay browser from the command line replayio record. This is just a stop gap solution until weâ€™re able to release the Replay browser as a standalone development browser.
---

{% steps %}

## Start recording

Run the following command to launch the Replay browser and start recording your application.

```sh
npx replayio record
```

{% callout showIcon=false title=""%}
You will be prompted to log into Replay with your default browser the first time you use Replay CLI.

{% /callout%}

## View your replay

The CLI will upload replays in the background and give you a url every time you close a tab.

```sh
View replay of localhost:3000
https://app.replay.io/recording/5d663446-d855-44c5-934-2ff20eaff9e2
```

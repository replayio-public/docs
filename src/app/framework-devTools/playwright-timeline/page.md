## Basics

Replay’s playwright panel is similar to the Trace Viewer, but includes functionality that’s only possible with time travel.

### Inspect test steps

When you select a test step, you jump to point in time where it was executed.

### Inspect step source code

Selecting a test step shows the source code where the test step is defined.

## Time Travel

### Jump to code

When you click the **jump to code **button you seek from the step action into your React component’s event handler. There’s never been a faster way to start debugging a flaky test.

## API Keys

Teams can create API Keys for uploading [source maps](https://docs.replay.io/getting-started/teams-admin/uploading-source-maps) during deploys or uploading replays recorded programmatically via our [Node](<https://docs.replay.io/reference-guide/recording/replay-node-(experimental)>), [Playwright](https://docs.replay.io/test-suites/playwright/installation), or [**Puppeteer**](https://docs.replay.io/test-suites/puppeteer) recorders.

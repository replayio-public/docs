# Playwright

## Install the Replay plugin

**1. Install the [@replayio/playwright](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replayio/playwright) package into your project:**

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @replayio/playwright -D
```

**2. Add Replay Chromium browser and Replay Reporter to your `playwright.config.ts` file.**

```tsx {2,5-8,11,12} filename="playwright.config.ts"
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'
import { devices as replayDevices } from '@replayio/playwright'

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    [
      '@replayio/playwright/reporter',
      {
        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY,
        upload: true,
      },
    ],
    ['line'],
  ],
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'replay-chromium',
      use: { ...(replayDevices['Replay Chromium'] as any) },
    },
  ],
}
export default config
```

## Setup Replay Dashboard

First, create a new team in Replay to organize your Playwright replays. Youâ€™ll also need an API Key to upload your replays and team API keys have much higher limits than personal API keys.

**1. Go to your Replay Dashboard and create a new team**

Alternatively, you can visit [this link](https://app.replay.io/team/new) to instantly create a new team.

Test Suites are currently in closed Beta. If youâ€™d like to start recording your tests, test suites need to be enabled in your team. Join our [**waitlist**](https://replayio.typeform.com/to/jTudlerL) and weâ€™ll reach out to you as soon as possible.

**2. Once youâ€™ve created a team, click on the settings <MaterialSymbolsSettings className="w-6 h-6 inline-block" /> icon next to your team name and [create a new API Key](/replay-teams/setting-up-a-team#api-keys)**

**3. Save the API key in your environment as `REPLAY_API_KEY`**. You can run your tests locally or using your CI provider.

## Record your tests

### Recording Locally

Once you have added Chromium Replay Browser to your project, you are ready to create your recordings. These will be available in your [Replay Dashboard](https://app.replay.io). You can run your tests normally, using `npx playwright test{:sh}` command.

If your project has multiple browsers set up, you can run Replay Browser only:

```sh
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```

```ansi
âžœ npx playwright test

Running 1 test using 1 worker
[1/1] things-app.spec.ts:14:7 â€º Todos â€º should allow me to add todo items
[replay.io]: ðŸ•‘ Completing some outstanding work ...
[replay.io]:
[replay.io]: ðŸš€ Successfully uploaded 1 recordings:
[replay.io]:
[replay.io]:    âœ… should allow me to add todo items
  1 passed (2.1s)
```

### Integrate into your CI workflow

Replay is designed to record tests in CI so you can debug when tests fail. Without Replay, test failures in CI are like a black box, with little insights into what went wrong. By recording with Replay, you get a full recording of the test run with debugging tools built in.

Here are basic configurations for some of the most popular providers which you can add to you project

<Tabs items={['GitHub Actions']}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```yml filename=".github/workflows/e2e.yml" copy
name: End-to-end tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  cypress-run:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: npx playwright test
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps

Your replays will now be recorded on each test run. You can find all your replays in Test Suite Dashboard.

## Install the Playwrigh Plugin package into your project

{% tabs labels=["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"] %}
  {% tab %}
  ```sh
  npm install @replayio/playwright -D
  ```
  {% /tab %}
  {% tab %}
  ```sh
  yarn add @replayio/playwright -D
  ```
  {% /tab %}
  {% tab %}
  ```sh
  pnpm install @replayio/playwright -D
  ```
  {% /tab %}
  {% tab %}
  ```sh
  bun install @replayio/playwright -D
  ```
  {% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Update your configuration

```js {% fileName="playwright.config.ts" highlight=[2,"5-8",11,12] %}
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test'
import { devices as replayDevices } from '@replayio/playwright'

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    [
      '@replayio/playwright/reporter',
      {
        apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY,
        upload: true,
      },
    ],
    ['line'],
  ],
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'replay-chromium',
      use: { ...(replayDevices['Replay Chromium'] as any) },
    },
  ],
}
export default config
```

## Generate and save your API key
In order to automatically upload your test replays you need to save an API key in your environment. To generate an API key, log in to Replay App open the settings menu. [Read more](/ci-workflows/generate-api-key).

## Record your test

Once you have added Chromium Replay Browser to your project, you are ready to create your recordings. You can run your tests normally, using `npx playwright test` command.

If your project has multiple browsers set up, you can run Replay Browser only:

```sh
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```

```sh
âžœ npx playwright test

Running 1 test using 1 worker

```

### Integrate into your CI workflow

Replay is designed to record tests in CI so you can debug when tests fail. Without Replay, test failures in CI are like a black box, with little insights into what went wrong. By recording with Replay, you get a full recording of the test run with debugging tools built in.

Here are basic configurations for some of the most popular providers which you can add to you project

## Done!

Youâ€™re ready to inspect your local test run in Replay DevTools now. You can also record your tests in your CI environment. Learn how to set up Replay with your Cypress tests on [GitHub Actions](/test-runners/playwright/github-actions) and [other CI providers](/test-runners/playwright/other-ci-providers).

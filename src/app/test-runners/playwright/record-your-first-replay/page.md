## Create a new testsuite team

Start by visiting our [new testsuite form](https://app.replay.io/team/new/tests).
It will create an API key and guide you through each step.

## Install the Playwright Plugin package into your project

{% tabs labels=["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"] %}
{% tab %}

```sh
npm install @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
yarn add @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
pnpm install @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
bun install @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

{% callout title="Note" type="note" %}
We recommend using the current `@alpha` version of this plugin. It's more robust and better but we are still polishing it. If you encounter any problems with it you can use `@replayio/playwright@latest`. We'd appreciate feedback and bug reports to be reported [here](https://github.com/replayio/replay-cli/issues/new).
{% /callout %}

## Save your API key

To use your API key, you can either use [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and save it to a `.env` file or add the API key to your environment directly.

{% tabs labels=[".env", "macOS/Linux", "Windows"] %}
{% tab %}

```bash {% fileName=".env" %}
REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
export REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
set REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Update your configuration

```js {% fileName="playwright.config.ts" highlight=["2-5","10-13","17-20"] lineNumbers=true %}
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";
import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from "@replayio/playwright";
import "dotenv/config";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    replayReporter({
      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY,
      upload: true,
    }),
    ["line"],
  ],
  projects: [
    {
      name: "replay-chromium",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Chromium"] },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

## Record your test

Once you have added Chromium Replay Browser to your project, you are ready to create your recordings. You can run your tests normally, using `npx playwright test` command.

If your project has multiple browsers set up, you can run Replay Browser only:

```sh
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```

```sh
âžœ npx playwright test

Running 1 test using 1 worker
[1/1] things-app.spec.ts:14:7 â€º Todos â€º should allow me to add todo items

```

### Integrate into your CI workflow

Replay is designed to record tests in CI so you can debug when tests fail. Without Replay, test failures in CI are like a black box, with little insights into what went wrong. By recording with Replay, you get a full recording of the test run with debugging tools built in.

Here are basic configurations for some of the most popular providers which you can add to you project

## Done!

Youâ€™re ready to inspect your local test run in Replay DevTools now. You can also record your tests in your CI environment. Learn how to set up Replay with your Cypress tests on [GitHub Actions](/test-runners/playwright/github-actions) and [other CI providers](/test-runners/playwright/other-ci-providers).

# Recording tests locally

In our experience, recording a replay gives you the most value when used in CI. It brings observability to otherwise hidden process. 

That said, to get you started, or to get a quick feedback on a stubborn test, running locally may be the a great way to get some insight into your test behavior.

## Configuration
Basic configuration of your Playwright project may look something like this. There are 2 key aspects:

1. `reporter` - Replay is integreated as a reporter to Playwright. the `line` reporter in this configuration points to default Playwright reporter that outputs test results into timeline.
2. `replay-chromium` project. This is Replay Browser. Itâ€™s a browser built on Chromioum with the recording capabilities. 

```tsx {2,5-8,11,12} filename="playwright.config.ts"
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";
import { devices as replayDevices } from "@replayio/playwright";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [["@replayio/playwright/reporter", {
      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY,
      upload: true
  }], ['line']],
  projects: [
    {
      name: "replay-chromium",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Chromium"] as any },
    }
  ],
};
export default config;
```

### Options
- `apiKey` (required) - this is the key that ensures communication with Test Suite Dashboard. Your recordings are uploaded using this key.
- `upload` - Set to `false` by default. This option determines whether you want to upload your recordings automatically to your [Test Suite Dashboard](/test-suites/runs-view). 

## Uploading replays manually
Recordings are created automatically when using `replay-chromium` browser, but you can choose to upload your recordings manually. You can use our [Replay CLI](/reference-guide/recording/replay-cli) for that. We recommend installing it globally:

```sh npm2yarn
npm install @replayio/replay -g
```

Use `replay ls` command to view the list of your recordings.
```ansi
$ replay ls

```

Replays are uploaded locally using the `@replayio/replay` CLI. Your API key must be set as the `REPLAY_API_KEY` environment variable to upload.

### Upload all replays
To upload all available replays, use the following command:
```sh
replay upload-all
```

### Upload a single replay
To upload just a single replay, copy the ID from the `replay ls` output and use following command:
```sh
replay upload 7585b8f4-6475-4535-995d-4d8a0c50f829 # example replay id
```

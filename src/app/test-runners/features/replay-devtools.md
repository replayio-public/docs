# Replay DevTools

Replay provides a recording of everything that happened in your browser during a test run. This allows you to:

- View the DOM and inspect elements at the point of failure
- See all Network activity, including request and response bodies
- Validate React component state and props at every step of the test
- View source code execution, including how many times a line of code ran during the test
- Add console logs retroactively to examine values at different points in time
- In Cypress, view the test code execution and the command log to confirm the test ran as expected
- And more!

## Overview

When it’s difficult to describe what you’re looking at in a Slack message, a Linear issue, or Replay comment, one of the best ways to collaborate with others is to record a Loom of what you’re looking at in Replay DevTools.

There’s something simple and powerful about recording your screen and walking through your thought process. We found enough people doing this, that we went ahead and integrated Loom, to make it that much easier to share video comments with your team.

### Basics

Simply record a Loom and paste the URL in the comment.

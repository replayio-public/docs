title: Record your Playwright tests

{% steps %}

## Create a new testsuite team

Start by visiting our [new testsuite form](https://app.replay.io/team/new/tests).
It will create an API key and guide you through each step.

## Install the Playwright Plugin package into your project

{% tabs labels=["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"] %}
{% tab %}

```sh
npm install @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
yarn add @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
pnpm install @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
bun install @replayio/playwright -D
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Save your API key

To use your API key, you can either use [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and save it to a `.env` file or add the API key to your environment directly.

{% tabs labels=[".env", "macOS/Linux", "Windows"] %}
{% tab %}

```bash {% fileName=".env" %}
REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
export REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
set REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Update your configuration

```js {% fileName="playwright.config.ts" highlight=[2, "7-10","14-17"] lineNumbers=true %}
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";
import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from "@replayio/playwright";
import "dotenv/config";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    replayReporter({
      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY,
      upload: true,
    }),
    ["line"],
  ],
  projects: [
    {
      name: "replay-chromium",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Chromium"] },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

## Record your test

Once you have added Chromium Replay Browser to your project, you are ready to create your recordings. You can run your tests normally, using `npx playwright test` command.

If your project has multiple browsers set up, you can run Replay Browser only:

```sh
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```

```sh
âžœ npx playwright test

Running 1 test using 1 worker
[1/1] things-app.spec.ts:14:7 â€º Todos â€º should allow me to add todo items

```

## Record your tests in CI

Now that you're ready to inspect your local tests, the next step is to record your tests in CI. Learn how to set up Replay with your Playwright tests on [GitHub Actions](/reference/test-runners/playwright/github-actions) and [other CI providers](/reference/test-runners/playwright/other-ci-providers).

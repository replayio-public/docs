title: Record your Playwright tests

{% steps %}

## Create a new Test Suite team

Start by visiting our [new test suite form](https://app.replay.io/team/new/tests).
It will create an API key and guide you through each step.

## Install the Replay Playwright plugin

{% tabs labels=["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun"] %}
{% tab %}

```sh
npm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
yarn add --save-dev @replayio/playwright
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
pnpm install --save-dev @replayio/playwright
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
bun install --save-dev @replayio/playwright
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Install the Replay browser.

```sh
npx replayio install
```

## Save your API key

To use your API key, you can either use [dotenv package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) and save it to a `.env` file or add the API key to your environment directly.

{% tabs labels=[".env", "macOS/Linux", "Windows"] %}
{% tab %}

```bash {% fileName=".env" %}
REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
export REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% tab %}

```sh
set REPLAY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

{% /tab %}
{% /tabs %}

## Update playwright.config.js

```js {% fileName="playwright.config.ts" highlight=[2, "7-10","14-17"] lineNumbers=true %}
import { PlaywrightTestConfig, devices } from "@playwright/test";
import { devices as replayDevices, replayReporter } from "@replayio/playwright";
import "dotenv/config";

const config: PlaywrightTestConfig = {
  reporter: [
    replayReporter({
      apiKey: process.env.REPLAY_API_KEY,
      upload: true,
    }),
    ["line"],
  ],
  projects: [
    {
      name: "replay-chromium",
      use: { ...replayDevices["Replay Chromium"] },
    },
  ],
};
export default config;
```

## Record your test

With everything set up, you can now run `playwright test` to record and upload your first Playwright replays.

```sh
npx playwright test --project replay-chromium
```

```sh
âžœ npx playwright test

## Record your tests in CI

Now that you're ready to inspect your local tests, the next step is to record your tests in CI. Learn how to set up Replay with your Playwright tests on [GitHub Actions](/reference/test-runners/playwright/github-actions) and [other CI providers](/reference/test-runners/playwright/other-ci-providers).

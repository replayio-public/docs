[Preview deployments from Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/preview-deployments) are a great way to preview your app before merging to main branch. The build of a preview deployment is usually triggered by pull request. It usually takes a couple of seconds or minutes to create a build and deploy it. At the end of the process, Vercel will provide a custom URL where this deployment can be viewed. 

Preview deployments are also useful for running end-to-end tests against. Since thereâ€™s a delay between the `pull_request` event and the actual deployment being ready, we recommend using `wait-for-vercel-preview` action, and add it as a dependency for your test step.

This approach is slightly different from the [recommended pattern from Vercel](https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-run-end-to-end-tests-after-my-vercel-preview-deployment), but carries a significant advantage. Replay PR Comments bot will add a list of all passed, failed and flaky tests, and links to replays that you can debug. This will help you debug any problems that occurred during a test run and prevent them from passing into production.

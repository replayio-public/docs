## Overview

Replay Firefox was our first runtime, so it’ll always have a special place in our hearts, but because Chrome has such a significant market share and browser tests that pass reliably on Chrome, fail intermittently in Firefox, we decided in 2023 that we had to bet on Chrome and sadly stop maintaining Replay Firefox for the time being.

### Use Cases

Even though Replay Firefox is currently deprecated, it will continue to be available until for two use cases.

1.  Downloading a standalone browser for recording bug reports.

2.  Recording bug reports on Windows. Replay Firefox Windows has a 40% replay crash rate, so we only recommend trying it if you’re okay putting up with the reliability issues

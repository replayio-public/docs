# Library

The **Replay Library** is your home for accessing replays, updating settings including Billing, and launching the [Replay Browser](/reference-guide/recording/replay-browser).

You can access your library by logging in at [app.replay.io](https://app.replay.io) from any browser — you do not need to have the Replay Browser installed. If it is installed, you can click the blue “Launch Replay” button to open the browser.

## Viewing replays

You can view replays from your personal library and from any teams available to you. Switch between libraries by clicking on a team in the left sidebar.

Within a library, you can browse or search replays. The library view shows the visibility, author, and number of comments for each replay.

## Editing/deleting a replay

You can rename, delete, or change the visibility or team association for replays you have recorded in your library. Click the three-dot menu icon on any individual replay to edit, or click the Edit button to make changes to multiple replays at once.

## Updating user settings

View your user profile settings by clicking “View settings” under your name at the bottom of the left sidebar. See [User Settings](/resources/get-help/user-settings) for more details.

## Updating team settings

Access team settings by clicking the gear icon next to the team name in the sidebar. You can also create a new team from the sidebar. See [Team Settings](/getting-started/teams-admin/team-settings) for more details.

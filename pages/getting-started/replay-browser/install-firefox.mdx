# Installing Replay Firefox

To start recording your own replays, you first need to install the **Replay browser**.

## Mac

To install Replay for Mac, follow these steps:
1. Download Replay [here](https://www.replay.io/downloads/replay.dmg)
2. Open the `.dmg` file and drag the icon to your Applications folder
3. Open Replay from your Applications folder


## Linux

To install Replay for Linux, follow these steps:
1. Download Replay for Linux [here](https://www.replay.io/downloads/linux-replay.tar.bz2)
2. Install the necessary dependencies

**Dependencies**

You will need to install `libgtk` version 3.0 (for libgtk-3.so.0) and `libdbus-glib` version 1.2 (for libdbus-glib-1.so.2). These may already be installed on your distribution if you use Ubuntu or Fedora. If you have Firefox installed, then you already have these shared libraries.

A simple way to get setup on most Linux distributions is to first install Firefox which will install the necessary dependencies. After that, it should be easy to download Replay and get started.

Check out our [Linux Support guide](/getting-started/replay-browser/linux-support) for more details.

## Windows

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
We launched Replay for Windows as an experiment in 2021.
We've since migrated from Firefox to Chrome and hope to release Chrome for Windows next year.
In the meantime, you're welcome to continue using our Firefox Windows browser, but just know that there's a decent chance that the recordings will not be viewable.
</Callout>


To install Replay for Windows, follow these steps:

1. Download Replay [here](https://replay.io/downloads/windows-replay.zip)
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Open the folder in File Explorer and open replay.exe.

**Note: If you use Virus/Threat protection software, you may need to update the software to exclude the Replay Browser before using.**

If you notice any issues please reach out to us on [Discord](https://replay.io/discord) in #windows.

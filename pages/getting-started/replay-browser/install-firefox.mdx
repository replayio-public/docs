# Installing the Replay Firefox Browser

To start recording your own replays, you first need to install the **Replay Browser**. There are several ways to install it.

Installing the **Replay Browser** is only required to record replays. If you want to view an existing replay, open it in any browser and skip straight to debugging.

## Mac

To instal Replay Browser for Mac, follow these steps:
1. Download Replay browser [here](https://www.replay.io/downloads/replay.dmg)
2. Open `.dmg` file and drag Replay Browser icon to your Applications folder
3. Open Replay Browser from your Applications folder

## Windows (BETA)

To install our Windows build, follow these steps:

1. Download Replay Browser for Windows (BETA) [here](https://replay.io/downloads/windows-replay.zip)
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Open the folder in File Explorer and open replay.exe. The Replay Browser should now launch.

**Note: If you use Virus/Threat protection software, you may need to update the software to exclude the Replay Browser before using.**

If you notice any issues please reach out to us on [Discord](https://replay.io/discord) in #windows or [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/replayio/gecko-dev/issues).

## Linux

To install Linux version, download Replay Browser for Linux [here](https://www.replay.io/downloads/linux-replay.tar.bz2)

### Dependencies
You will need to install `libgtk` version 3.0 (for libgtk-3.so.0) and `libdbus-glib` version 1.2 (for libdbus-glib-1.so.2). These may already be installed on your distribution if you use Ubuntu or Fedora. If you have Firefox installed, then you already have these shared libraries.

A simple way to get setup on most Linux distributions is to first install Firefox which will install the necessary dependencies. After that, it should be easy to download Replay and get started.

Check out our [Linux Support guide](/getting-started/replay-browser/linux-support) for more details.

# Installing the Replay browser

To start recording your own replays, you first need to install the **Replay Browser**. There are several ways to install it.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Installing the **Replay Browser** is only required to record replays. If you want to view an existing replay, open it in any browser and skip straight to debugging.
</Callout>

## CLI (Replay Chrome) <Tag>New</Tag>
Replay Chrome is currently built for automated recordings with tools like Playwright and Cypress so it does not have a record button yet. If you would like to use Chrome to record a replay, you can use the `replay` CLI.

```sh copy
npm i @replayio/replay -g
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
We recommend installing the Replay CLI globally. This will add `replay` to your path so you can skip `npx` and just call `replay` directly
</Callout>

To open Replay type following command into your terminal

```sh copy
replay record http://localhost:3000
```

The `http://localhost:3000` is the URL of an application that you want to start recording. Recording will automatically stop when you close the browser. To check list of all your recordings type `replay ls` into your terminal. To see more details on how to use Replay CLI, [follow these docs](/reference-guide/recording/replay-cli).

1. Download Replay browser [here](https://www.replay.io/downloads/replay.dmg)
2. Open `.dmg` file and drag Replay Browser icon to your Applications folder
3. Open Replay Browser from your Applications folder

## Windows (BETA)

To install our Windows build, follow these steps:

1. Download Replay Browser for Windows (BETA) [here](https://replay.io/downloads/windows-replay.zip)
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Open the folder in File Explorer and open replay.exe. The Replay Browser should now launch.

**Note: If you use Virus/Threat protection software, you may need to update the software to exclude the Replay Browser before using.**

If you notice any issues please reach out to us on [Discord](https://replay.io/discord) in #windows or [submit an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/replayio/gecko-dev/issues).

## Linux

To install Linux version, download Replay Browser for Linux [here](https://www.replay.io/downloads/linux-replay.tar.bz2)

### Dependencies
You will need to install `libgtk` version 3.0 (for libgtk-3.so.0) and `libdbus-glib` version 1.2 (for libdbus-glib-1.so.2). These may already be installed on your distribution if you use Ubuntu or Fedora. If you have Firefox installed, then you already have these shared libraries.

A simple way to get setup on most Linux distributions is to first install Firefox which will install the necessary dependencies. After that, it should be easy to download Replay and get started.

Check out our [Linux Support guide](/getting-started/replay-browser/linux-support) for more details.

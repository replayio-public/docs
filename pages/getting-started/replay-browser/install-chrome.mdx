# Installing Replay Chrome

To start recording your own replays, you first need to install the **Replay Browser**.


[Firefox](/getting-started/replay-browser/replay-firefox) is our default browser today for legacy reasons, but Chrome is better in almost every way. The only catch is that it is currently headless, but if you're willing to launch it from CLI and upload recordings manually, you can use it today.

<Steps>
### Install Replay CLI
```bash npm2yarn copy
npm i @replayio/replay -g
```
### Record your site
```bash copy
replay record http://localhost:3000
```
### Upload your recording
``` bash
replay login; 
replay ls; # print all your replays
replay upload <id> # upload a replay of your choice
```
### Open Replay DevTools
...and start debugging

Chrome for Windows is experimental and there is a decent chance that recordings will not be viewable.

# Installing Replay Chrome

To start recording your own replays, you first need to install the **Replay Browser**.


[Firefox is our default browser](/getting-started/replay-browser/replay-firefox) today for legacy reasons, but Chrome is our future and is better in almost every way. Replay DevTools has the latest Elements and React Panel, print statements are faster, paints are more accurate, and if there is an issue while replaying we will fix it. 

The only catch is that the browser is currently headless and unsigned which means you need to launch it and upload recordings from our CLI.

<Steps>
### Install Replay CLI
```bash npm2yarn copy
npm i @replayio/replay -g
```
### Record your site
```bash copy
replay record http://localhost:3000
```
### Upload your recording
``` bash
replay login; 
replay ls; # print all your replays
replay upload <id> # upload a replay of your choice
```
### Open Replay DevTools
...and start debugging

Chrome for Windows is experimental and there is a decent chance that recordings will not be viewable.
